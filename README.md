# earprints

Hello there! This is the project from the idea of making the ear pattern as biometrics.

One day, we came to know that human ears patterns are different for each person and also different from each other.

So, we attempted to use this feature to make ear biometrics with the use of deep learning.

I hope this project will amaze you with how easy and simple for implementing the ear biometric rather than fingers, eyes and face as biometrics.
